Natalie has successfully competed at FEI levels in Australia, Germany, and the in the United States. After studying and training in Germany for three years Natalie completed her Bereiter training from the Equestrian Association E.V., Warendorf, Germany.

Her talent and love of horses has allowed her to reach levels of competition only few can strive for, as well as allowed her to educate her students to reach beyond their own riding goals.

Natalie's ambitions include continuing to compete in International events, as well as to continue to educate and work with other riders.
