# Hi, I am Natalie Hammond

Natalie Hammond (Ottiger) started riding horses at an early age which has allowed her to compete and train internationally. Natalie has successfully competed at FEI levels. She has competed internationally in both Germany and Australia. After studying and training in Germany for three years Natalie completed her Bereiter training from the Equestrian Association E.V., Warendorf, Germany.

Her talent and love of horses has allowed her to reach levels of competition only few can strive for, as well as allowed her to educate her students to reach beyond their own riding goals.

Natalie's ambitions include continuing to compete in International events, as well as to continue to educate and work with other riders.

Natalie now resides in Wildwood, Missouri with her husband Chris and their kids.
